# Time_dom_ecc_solns
Core code to produce numerical PN solutions to orbital dynamics, strain in the time and frequency domain for Eccentric Binaries. Main product is the TaylorT4e and TaylorT4t approximants detailed in arXiv:1903.05203. Requires Boost, fftw, and GSL. 
TODO: Add a main with some simple examples.
